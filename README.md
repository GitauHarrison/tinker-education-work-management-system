# Tinker Education Work Management System

**Automate everything that can be automated**

&nbsp;

As a learning center, there sure are things that have to be done routinely. Things such as:

* Student registration

* Course allocation

* Finance management

* Parent/student engagement with the learning center

&nbsp;

These are things that are the lifeline of the business and atmost care need to be taken when handling them. Why not preserve the goal of maintaining quality throughout every aspect of the business by having a __reliable partner__ do all these things for you?

&nbsp;

__reliable partner__ aka __automation__

A _user's journey_ can be captured right from the time they start engaging with the learning center. This can be from the center's website (and later on, a mobile app?!)

&nbsp;

From there on, no one has to worry about subsequent steps that need to be done to fully get the user settled as the center's client. Because, the experience would be seamless, tireless, hands-off and automated!

&nbsp;

This way, quality of the most trivial things are going to be guaranteed. _Let your energy be well spent on things that build you._
